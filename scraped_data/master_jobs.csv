+3","Full-Stack Developer / DevOps Lead – SaaS Platform Ownership
Location: Remote (within 2 hours of NYC)
Type: Full-time employee
At Recovery Shop, we're revolutionizing the patient recovery experience through innovative technology and personalized care. We partner with surgeons, doctors, and clinics nationwide to deliver essential products, equipment, and insights directly to patients' homes, optimizing their preparation and healing journey. Our proprietary SaaS platform enables healthcare providers to customize treatment plans with tailored information sheets and product offerings - from consumables to rentable equipment – all seamlessly delivered to patients' doorsteps precisely when needed for their scheduled procedures.
As we rapidly expand into new markets and introduce disruptive capabilities to the healthcare tech space, we're seeking a DevOps guru to help scale our infrastructure and maintain the reliability our medical partners and their patients depend on. Join us in transforming the recovery experience and making a meaningful difference in patients' lives during their most vulnerable moments.
Recovery Shop is growing fast—and we’re ready to bring our SaaS system in-house.
We’re looking for a hands-on, smart, self-directed developer who can take ownership of our new platform (built on .NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, and AI-driven solutions like Replit and Lovable) as we move from third-party development to full internal control. If you’re the kind of person who thrives when handed the keys to something half-built, sees documentation gaps as puzzles to solve, and isn’t afraid of figuring things out under pressure—this could be a great fit.
You’ll be responsible for:
Taking over a newly developed SaaS system (about 60% complete) from an outside firm
Migrating and extracting data from a legacy Laravel-based system (read-only, no new dev needed)
Building and supporting apps and sites for e-commerce and operations
Expertise with Chat GPT/Claude AI/Grok solution and system prompting
Standing up our dev/test/prod environments and owning CI/CD
Supporting and refining the current platform with tactical independence
Adding new tools, features, and integrations over time—sometimes using off-the-shelf solutions, sometimes rolling your own
Collaborating directly with the founders and a strategic tech advisor to bring our big vision to life
Our Tech Stack:
.NET Core (C#), Angular (front end), SQL Server
Azure DevOps (repos, pipelines, deployment)
REST APIs (including payment integrations like Authorize.net)
Replit-developed apps in React JS and/or Python
Bonus points for Laravel/PHP familiarity (for legacy system data work only)
What We’re Looking For:
Someone who can thrive with high autonomy, but doesn’t disappear
Clear, proactive communicator who can explain technical choices to non-technical people
Comfortable making tactical decisions that balance stability, growth, and cost
Experience taking products from dev to launch to production support
Located within 2 hours of NYC and able to meet up occasionally
What We’re Not Looking For:
Someone who needs to be told what to do every day
Overconfidence without experience to back it up
Devs who avoid documentation like it’s radioactive
If this sounds like your kind of challenge, let’s talk.
We don’t care what degrees you have—we care what you can do and how you think.

Frontend Software Engineer,Lumafield,"San Francisco, CA 94107",,"$100,000 - $150,000 a year","About Lumafield:

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.

We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.

Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.

We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.

Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.

About the role:

Lumafield is bringing volumetric visualization, inspection and analysis tools to the web. Our growing web app is the primary channel through which customers access, view, and interact with their data and is an exciting alternative to the traditionally clunky, expensive, OS-specific software applications used in the past.

As a Frontend Engineer, you will work with designers and other developers to build thoughtful and functional interfaces to inspect, interact and analyze large volumetric data sets. You will have ownership over projects as you help us develop new features and get them into the hands of customers quickly. We are excited about building new tools in our React-based applications and frequently interface with a backend stack of Django, Postgres, AWS and other technologies to support fast data processing and access. We don’t expect you to be an expert in all of these technologies, but an eagerness to engage with them is a huge plus.

If you are interested in joining a well-funded growth stage company this is the perfect opportunity for you to become a part of the Lumafield team.
What you'll do:
Build and iterate on intuitive user interfaces for interacting with 3D data
Write production-ready, well-tested code utilizing React, Redux, Typescript, Three.js, and WebGL
Collaborate with other frontend engineers via code reviews and technical discussions
Work cross functionally with a team of designers, engineers across a range of disciplines, and scientists
Communicate and document technical and architectural decisions
About you:
Have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, computer science, or related field, along with 2+ years of experience in frontend development
Have designed and implemented software throughout its lifecycle, taking a product from napkin sketches through shipping and maintenance
Have worked with a team to build software
Are customer obsessed and passionate about building high performance, user-friendly web apps
Can rapidly develop UI elements and new features in collaboration with designers and engineers
Bonus points:
Experience with 3D graphics, especially for web applications
Previous experience with digital or other manufacturing and design technologies
A portfolio of previous work that you can share
The base salary range listed here represents the anticipated low and high end of the salary range for this position. Actual salaries may vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors including but not limited to work location, experience, and performance. All full time employees receive an equity grant.

Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more!

React web engineer,GMV,"Remote in Los Angeles, CA",,"$80,000 - $120,000 a year","Fully Remote | Offices available in Los Angeles & Houston
Mid-Level Role (3-5 years experience)
Well, this is not your average job ad, and we're not looking for your average engineer. Interested? Let's dig in.
1️⃣ Who we are

Our company was founded in 2006 specializing in all things technical for bus-based public transit systems in the US. This means we design, manufacture, and manage all kinds of different products and features, including driver interfaces, dispatch communications, passenger counters, announcers, GPS tracking, and reporting & data analytics. It also means we build real-time information systems for riders including apps and digital signage found at bus stops. We have relationships with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Transit app, and our work goes out to millions of riders on those platforms. Our product is like air traffic control, but for buses. There are a mix of hardware and software products in this role. We hope this excites you!

The US-based division of the company has approximately 50 people, with 15 in the product/engineering department. It’s the best of both worlds: small company feel with big company support.

We are fully remote with offsites once or twice a year and physical offices that some folks choose to use in Downtown LA & Houston, TX.
2️⃣ We’re here to serve customers
Our customers are public transit operators. Their customers are the transit riding public, which is often people who have far less than we do. Our job is to Make Transit Work for them. We take this mission very seriously, and to put it bluntly: we want engineers who are here to solve problems and serve customers as our first priority. While this isn’t an easy job and we don’t do a lot of handholding, our process is flexible and we’re interested in constantly delivering value in whatever way works best for the situation at hand.

If you want to be challenged with growth opportunities in a small team environment with high autonomy and see your work live on thousands of transit buses nationwide, then we are the team for you.
3️⃣ We’re looking for passion
We value engineers who like to ship solutions to problems and aren't afraid to receive direct feedback about why a particular solution may or may not be the best. We value people who enjoy being wrong and learning something new about why in the process, recognizing that the team has something to learn from everyone on it. We value people who challenge & support their peers, pressing them to be better versions of themselves and up-level the team.

Recognizing the importance of time-to-market for our business and our users, a sense of optimism and exploration to find solutions and deliver great things with high quality is important. Whether you’re hunting through legacy code or writing our latest greenfield product, you’ll be tackling big challenges and we’re looking for people who love the excitement of delivering to the end user more than anything.

This kind of transparency, passion, and professionalism is what makes a world-class engineering team.
4️⃣ What we need you to do in this role
You will be contributing in a significant way to customer facing features on our system. If you take pleasure in pixel perfect UI design and thinking through UX implications while troubleshooting complex challenges, this job is for you. The role is heavily web focused to start with opportunities to gain experience across our tech stack over time.
We need someone with:
Strong React/web skills
Experience in C#
3-5 years of total experience
We’re looking for someone who will grow with us for the long term
This is a mid-level engineering role that is great for someone looking for a place to take their skills to the next level. We also value interest in technology, transportation, and non-traditional, wide-ranging backgrounds.
5️⃣ Pay and Benefits

We can’t offer stock (not available from parent company), but we can offer cash comp, great benefits, and a career-making move for you.
$80k - $120k plus 15% bonus potential
Generous health and dental benefits
Generous paid parental leave after one year
401k plan with company match
Flexible hours and location
Most of our work happens on Slack, but once or twice a year we get together in person to collaborate within and across our teams. Our company is a small one with great culture, and you're going to have fun being a part of it

Our team is passionate, our product makes a difference. Let us sell you on that. We’ll show you this during the interview process, and we promise you won't be disappointed.

6️⃣ To apply, you must send more than a resume–we need to understand who you are

We don't need a formal sir or madam cover letter, but we do need to see you taking the application seriously, which means writing a note to us telling us why this job appeals to you. Include specifics about your experience in the above technologies, what your ideal team looks like, how you manage conflict, or why you believe customer-first engineering is important.

In addition to completing the online application, the best way to get our attention is to email your note and resume to the hiring manager directly: careers-na [AT] gmv [DOT] com with the subject ""React Web Engineer."" The letter you write for us will be 10 times more valuable than your resume in getting our attention.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Pablo Durán Álvarez, in charge of this vacancy.

About Middesk Engineering:
We believe ""velocity"" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done?
When we’re coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves?
Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic).

The Role:
Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems.
We follow a hybrid work model, and for this role, there is an expectation of 2 days per week in our SF or NYC office. Candidates should be based within a commutable distance, as we believe in the value of in-person collaboration and building strong team connections while also supporting flexibility where possible.
What You'll Do:
Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers.
Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc.
Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products.
Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career, you have something to teach.
Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter.
Help us interview and hire other Engineers.
What We’re Looking For:
While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we’d love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster.
You’ve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it.
You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years.
You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics.",,2025-05-08,2025-05-08 20:22:15

Why this role is different
If you love turning fuzzy, half-formed ideas into elegant, working software—and you’re energized by problems nobody has solved yet—you’ll feel right at home here. We move quickly, value bold thinking over red tape, and give engineers the runway to own architecture decisions end-to-end. Your code will help hundreds of client teams keep mission-critical networks humming around the world.

Your impact & how you’ll make it happen
Shape the architecture of a multi-tenant, global SaaS platform that ingests billions of network events.
Lead design spikes and proof-of-concepts when requirements are not always complete.
Break down complex business problems into incremental, testable slices.
Drive process and set coding standards that raise the team’s bar.
Ship high-quality features, fast.
Write, review, and refactor Python/Django and React/Node code that is clean, observable, and cloud-native.
Automate tests and CI/CD pipelines (Docker + GitHub Actions) to get ideas from branch to production in minutes.
Tackle the gnarliest bugs.
Dive into syslogs, RADIUS/SNMP traces, and AWS CloudWatch logs to hunt down root causes.
Use data—not hunches—to guide permanent fixes.
Integrate anything with an IP address.
Design scalable APIs and event streams that let switches, firewalls, and third-party apps plug into our platform.
Harden integrations for performance and security at scale.
Mentor & collaborate.
Pair-program, model best practices in code reviews, and help product managers translate “what” into “how.”
The stack you’ll play with
Languages / Frameworks: Python, Django, REST, React, Node.js
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (EB, RDS PostgreSQL/Timescale, Lambda), Docker, GitHub, Puppet
Networking: SNMP, RADIUS, CoA, Ethernet switch, WiFi access points & firewall APIs
What we’re looking for
5+ years building and operating production web services (preferably SaaS)
Fluency in Python, Django and at least one modern front-end or services framework (React, Node, FastAPI, etc.)
Proven success shipping features when the problem and the solution were both unclear at the start
Solid command of Git, Linux, relational DB design, automated testing, and agile delivery
Ability to communicate trade-offs with both engineers and non-technical stakeholders
Depth in network protocols or managing wired/wireless infrastructure
Experience scaling time-series or event-driven data pipelines
Prior ownership of cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred)
Why you’ll love working here

Real impact – your ideas won’t sit in the backlog; they’ll power the networks our customers rely on every day.

COMPANY BACKGROUND…
“Going once! Going twice! Going three times! Sold!” This language, or something similar, is being heard more and more throughout the country as deeds to real estate are transferred from party to party. Utilized for many years in the rural sector, the auction method of selling real property is fast coming of age in the metropolitan areas. In the past, auction was considered a line of last resort. It is now being recognized by many as the most efficient, effective, and profitable method of marketing real estate. Also, the perception that only distressed property is sold at auction is fast disappearing. Throughout the land, large quantities of high dollar residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial property are being sold at auction. McCurdy Real Estate & Auction, LLC has been selling homes, farms, commercial, and personal property at public auction since its inception in 1982. We are licensed real estate brokers and auctioneers, in Kansas, Colorado Missouri, and Oklahoma.

At our company, passion isn't optional—it's essential. We're building transformative software solutions, guided by a small team with a bold vision. To thrive here, you'll need more than just strong technical skills; you'll need curiosity, adaptability, and a genuine love for technology. Our CTO lives and breathes innovation but needs the perfect counterpart—a developer who gets excited about turning ambitious ideas into reality through execution and tangible outcomes. If you're motivated by solving challenging problems, obsessed with staying ahead of the trends, and comfortable leveraging AI tools as valuable enhancements to your coding practice, you're exactly who we'd love to talk with.

You will collaborate closely with our CTO and Product team to ensure efficient integration, strong performance, and high code quality and security.
Manage and Optimize Databases:
You will administer and maintain our SQL databases, optimize performance, ensure reliability and security, and modernize legacy database structures. You'll also design and implement optimized databases to improve reporting and analytics.

You’ll contribute to microservices and distributed systems architecture, manage Git workflows, and maintain CI/CD pipelines. Experience with Docker, cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, and event-driven architectures like Kafka is required.
Leverage AI and New Technologies:
We strongly believe AI is the future. You must already incorporate AI tools into your daily coding processes. We expect you to stay up to date with emerging frameworks, tools, and best practices, and proactively introduce new solutions.

Collaboration and Consulting:
You will coordinate and manage work with external consultants, assess their skill sets, assign tasks, and ensure deliverables meet our high-quality standards, across multiple time zones when necessary.
Cultural Fit:
You must have strong written and verbal communication skills, demonstrate confident decision-making, and thrive in goal-oriented, problem-solving environments. This role demands someone who embraces continuous learning, actively seeks challenges, and genuinely loves technology.
Work Environment:
While this position is flexible and primarily remote-friendly, candidates located locally or within commuting distance to our office are strongly preferred. Being able to come onsite at least once per week will be considered a significant advantage in our hiring process.

Software Engineer (Internal Tools),Column,"Hybrid work in San Francisco, CA",,"$80,000 - $120,000 a year, Paid parental leave, Parental leave, Health insurance, Vision insurance, Health savings account, ","About Column
For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.

At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!
The opportunity:
You’ll be responsible for building the software that allow us to move and build faster at Column. While other companies will choose to hire an army of people, Column puts a huge emphasis on investing heavily in automation and tooling. You’ll be key person responsible for creating these tools— spending your time between both our frontend and backend engineering stacks.
You’ll write TypeScript/JS for our Retool-based internal tooling system, Typescript for our external developer dashboard, and dive into Golang on our backend. Ideally, you should have experience with Javascript, some experience with a typed back-end programming language (although experience with Golang is not required), and be very comfortable with SQL databases. This role is based San Francisco and you’ll be expected to work out of our (awesome) Presidio-based office 3+ days a week.
As one of the only new-graduate available roles at Column, this role will be a core feeder for other engineering or customer roles on the team - product, backend, or infrastructure engineering, or product and solutions-focused customer roles.
What you’ll need to be successful:
A computer science degree
Demonstrated expertise in Javascript. Some React experience is ideal but not required
Experience with a typed back-end language, coupled with proficiency in SQL
Ability to make independent product decisions and exhibit strong self-management skills.
Preferably, you should have experience or a keen interest in engaging with external customers to gather direct product feedback.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
Residence within <1h of our Presidio San Francisco-based office or the ability to relocate
What you’ll get from us:
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision plans, including options that are 100% covered by Column for you and 100% covered for your dependents!
Comprehensive family planning and fertility benefits via partnership with Carrot, including reimbursement of up to $20,000 in qualified expenses
FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
100% paid parental leave, including 16 weeks for birth mothers, 12 weeks for primary caregivers, and 8 weeks for secondary caregivers
Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
Commuter benefits
Regular team building events, including annual offsite
Pay transparency:
Compensation packages at Column include base salary, equity, and benefits. New hire offers are made based on a candidate's experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.
The annual US base salary range for this role is $80,000-$120,000 + equity.
We look forward to hearing from you
Column is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible. We value bringing together a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and believe a diversity of ideas is what allows us to develop the best solutions.

Front-End Developer - Kansas City Area,Native Metrics,"Kansas City, MO 64112",,"AD&D insurance, 401(k) matching, Paid time off, Vision insurance, Dental insurance, ","We need a Front-End Developer to join our growing business! This is a chance to get in on the ground floor of a startup and join a team with a positive track record of growing profitable technology-based companies. This position is an in-person role, with hours based in the Central US time zone. We are based in Kansas City, with offices in The Plaza area.

How You’ll Make an Impact:
We're looking for a Front-End Developer with a scrappy, “get it done” attitude and some experience building and maintaining high volume web pages powered by next.js. Experience in the digital advertising world is a plus, but it’s more important that you’re a problem solver who is hyper focused on achieving a goal and less focused on “perfect” code. We do a lot of “development in production” at the moment.
This position comes with a high degree of autonomy to decide how to solve each problem. It also comes with a high degree of ambiguity since the world of digital advertising is always changing! But in general, your day-to-day work includes:
You’ll contribute to fast-loading, high-traffic pages that personalize ad experiences based on URL query parameters, IP-based geolocation, and other user attributes. We cache expensive API responses and database queries in Redis to ensure sub-second load times, and we’ve built internal tools that let media buyers adjust those conditions without needing engineering support.
Designing and implementing tracking solutions to gather internal analytics or to provide a feedback loop to traffic providers like Facebook, Google, Taboola, etc.
Being the point person for troubleshooting as errors arise.
Collaborating with our team daily to scale our business, improve our products, and innovate on new solutions.
What Experience You Will Need:
We need ambitious, curious, scrappy team members. You will need to be able to work autonomously as well as collaboratively within our small team. The ideal candidate will have:
1-2 years working with high-volume JavaScript-powered web pages.
Experience with both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service suites.
Experience with databases, especially those that are useful for powering quick web results (we currently use EC2 instances with Redis for quick caching), but experience with other SQL-friendly databases as well is ideal.
Ability to triage with non-technical types and help them translate their requests and/or problems into technical solutions.
Benefits we offer at Native Metrics
Competitive salary and bonus compensation
Freedom Paid Time Off + 10 paid holidays
401k match up to 8%, Health/Vision/Dental, Flexible Spending Account

The Creative Knowledge Platform is a project dedicated to helping Knowledge Keepers maintain their traditions. The CKP offers a variety of opportunities to express the uniqueness within each city and to implement a local model to promote its Knowledge Keepers.
The CKP is composed of websites, apps, and virtual-reality environments that engage visitors in a simulated, expanded, and extended experience, guide visitors in the city’s spaces, and allow them to retain memory of the activities even after a visit.
